# BBC-News-Classification-using-NLP-and-Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
BBC News Classification using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning with Python and TensorFlow
In this project, I leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, including deep learning with libraries such as TensorFlow, to classify BBC news articles into various categories such as business, tech, sport, entertainment, and politics. I performed extensive text preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to prepare the dataset for modeling.
## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Regularization techniques (L2 regularization)
- CountVectorizer and TF-IDF for text representation
- Neural network models for classification
- Dropout for regularization
- Logistic Regression as a baseline model
